I"”<p>The EBSB club of IIITR is here with another competition for you: â€œmandala art contest! â€œ
So, come up! and bring out the artist in you.</p>

<p>What is a mandala?
The meaning of the word mandala in Sanskrit is circle. Mandala is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe. The circular designs symbolise the idea that life is never ending and everything is connected. It is sometimes drawn as a circle enclosing a square with a deity on each side that is mainly used to aid in meditation and yoga. Mandalas have many uses apart from meditation as the designs are meant to remove irritating thoughts and allow the creative mind to relax and run free. But ultimately people create and look at mandalas to centre the body and mind.
